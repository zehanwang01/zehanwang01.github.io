# About Me

**Zehan Wang (王泽寒)** is a PhD student in the College of Computer Science at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by [Prof. Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). 
I have published 10+ first-author papers at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML/CVPR.
My current research interests broadly span two areas:

1. Unified Multimodal Perception (2D pixels, 3D geometry, language, audio)

2. Spatial Intelligence in Visual Content (understanding —> generation)

My research is supported by the Fundamental Research Project for Young Ph.D. students from NSFC (国家自然科学基金博士青年基金).

**I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities in both academia and industry — feel free to reach out via email!**
